A sprint relay problem solution using mutex.

### The Problem

The Sprint Relay problem consists in race in which two teams that have four runners. The second, third and fourth runners can not start running until they receive the baton delivered by the runner who preceded it.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the modules below to run the program: 
* [go 1.0 or greater](https://golang.org/dl/)

### Running

There are two programs in this project. The sprintRelay.go file will simulate a team's race, while the sprintRelayExtra.go file will simulate the race between two teams. There are two ways to run this software:

* Compile the IDE (GoLand IDE):
1. Just open the IDE.
2. Import the files in a project.
3. After, click Ctrl+Shift+F10 to run the project.
4. From this it only interacts with the system.

* Compile by terminal:
1. Enter the following command to run the files of the project:
```
$ go run sprintRelayExtra.go
```
3. From this it only interacts with the system.

## Built With

* [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) - A IDE used
